.**1\. MVP Core: The Functional Heart of Medium**

This foundational phase is critical for establishing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that defines Medium's core value proposition. It focuses entirely on the essential, functional heart of the platform: the content-creation and consumption lifecycle. At its core, the MVP connects two primary user roles: the **Writers** and the **Readers**.

- **For Writers:** This phase provides the necessary tools for content generation, allowing them to create, draft, edit, and publish "stories" (or articles). The emphasis is on a simple, elegant, and distraction-free writing interface that encourages the creation of high-quality, long-form content.
- **For Readers:** This phase ensures a seamless mechanism for engaging with the published content. The primary modes of engagement are established here:
  - **Claps (or a similar initial feedback mechanism):** This serves as the fundamental metric for expressing approval, showing appreciation for the content, and providing immediate, low-friction feedback to the writers.
  - **Personalized Feeds:** This introduces a basic algorithm or content curation system designed to surface relevant stories to individual readers. The feed acts as the main gateway for content discovery, ensuring that the created stories reach a potential audience efficiently.

The successful completion of this MVP phase means the platform has a working ecosystem where content is produced, consumed, and validated, establishing the minimum necessary features for sustainable operation and future growth.

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Authentication** | Sign up, login, and a basic profile page (bio, avatar, username).                                                                      | `POST /api/auth/signupPOST /api/auth/login GET /api/user/:id (For Getting User Details)`                         | Implement **JWT** for stateless sessions. Use the `argon2` crate for secure password hashing.                                                   |
| **Story CRUD**          | Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete **long-form stories** (title, subtitle, rich content). Support Drafts vs. Published states. | `POST /api/stories` (auth) `GET /api/stories/:slug PUT /api/stories/:id` (auth) `DELETE /api/stories/:id` (auth) | Store content as **JSON** (for rich-text editors like TipTap) or well-structured Markdown/HTML. Focus on generating unique, readable **slugs**. |
| **Tags System**         | Attach up to 5 relevant tags per story to aid discovery and organization.                                                              | `GET /api/tagsGET /api/stories?tag=rust`                                                                         | Simple **Many-to-many** database relationship between stories and tags.                                                                         |
| **Reading & Feeds**     | A public feed showing the latest/popular stories and a simple personalized home feed. Implement robust pagination.                     | `GET /api/feed` (auth optional)`GET /api/stories` (public, with filters)                                         | Basic recommendation logic: sort by latest publication date or total claps in the last 24 hours.                                                |
| **Claps (Engagement)**  | The core social metric: allow users to clap multiple times per story (up to 50), tracking the total count.                             | `POST /api/stories/:id/clap` (auth)                                                                              | Use an **atomic counter** in your database for performance, ensuring quick, reliable updates.                                                   |
